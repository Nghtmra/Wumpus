// Initialization
Initialize Pygame
Load images (bat, player, wumpus, arrow, dead wumpus)
Initialize sounds (footsteps, jumpscare, ambient, breathing, shoot, wumpus death, blinded, wumpus move)
Set screen dimensions and create display
Define constants (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, colors)
Define cave map (adjacency list)
Initialize global variables:
    player_position
    wumpus_position
    bats_list
    pits_list
    arrows_list
    number_of_arrows
    game_over_flag
    countdown_timer
Initialize font

// Game Setup
Populate cave:
    Randomly place player
    Randomly place wumpus (avoiding player position)
    Randomly place bats (avoiding player, wumpus, and other bats)
    Randomly place pits (avoiding player, wumpus, bats, and other pits)
    Randomly place arrows (avoiding player, wumpus, bats, and pits)
Print game instructions
Get input to start game

// Main Game Loop
WHILE game_over_flag == FALSE DO
    Handle Pygame events:
        Check for quit event
        Check for arrow key presses:
            If shift key is held, shoot arrow in corresponding direction
            Otherwise, move player in corresponding direction (if valid move)
    Update game state:
        Move wumpus (if mobile and random condition met)
        Check room:
            If player is in same position as wumpus, game over
            If player is in a pit, game over
            If player is in a bat location, move player and bats randomly, play blinded sound
            If player is in an arrow location, increment arrow count, play sound
    Draw game elements:
        Draw room background
        Draw exits
        Draw player
        Draw bats (if present)
        Draw wumpus (if present)
        Draw text (position, arrows remaining, clues)
    Update display
    Check wumpus distance:
        Play breathing sound if wumpus is nearby, stop otherwise
    Update timer:
        Calculate remaining time
        If time runs out, game over
    Draw timer on screen
    Update display
ENDWHILE

// Game Over
If game over due to time, print "You ran out of time!"
If game over due to wumpus or pit, print appropriate message
If game over due to winning, print "You Win!"
Quit Pygame
